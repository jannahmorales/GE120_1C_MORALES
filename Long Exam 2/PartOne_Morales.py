1. Differentiate Procedural Programming from Object-Oriented Programming.
- Procedural Programming is centered on the sequence in which the code performs certain actions, it also allows a code to be written
for the different conditions necessary to perform a function. It emphasizes visualizing the sequence of actions that a code is written for.
Meanwhile, object-oriented programming is meant to eliminate redundancy through the use of classes and inheritance. Object-oriented
programming has a primary class with assigned attributes and the sub-classes under it inherit these attributes and can have their own functions
or methods as well.

2. What is a GUI and how does it help creating programs and applications for geomatics applications?
- A GUI is basically a user interface that allows users to interact with a code to perform particular actions. Applications or websites are
created with the purpose of making a certain process easier, a GUI would be where a user can interact with the program or how the program
appears to the user. In geomatics in particular, an example would be an application for converting azimuth to bearing and vice versa, the GUI
would be the screen seen by the user of the app, while the actual functions used to convert are not visible to the user.


3. What is operation overloading in OOP?
- Operation overloading in OOP is using a combination of operations to perform another operation, these operations can be expressed as methods
sandwiched between double underscores. Operation overloading makes it possible to repeatedly use the same operators for different purposes.

4. Discuss the concept of Inheritance in object-oriented programming
- The concept of inheritance in object-oriented programming is self-explanatory, there is a "parent" class with its own attributes,
and a "child" class which inherits these attributes as well. A class is created with certain attributes and objects 'inherit' the attributes of 
the class, they will have the same characteristics unless they are overridden by giving the subclass or "child" class the same attribute with
a different value.

5. Differentiate front-end, back-end, and database in Full Stack development.
- Front-end is the part that is visible to the users, it is visually appealing and is how users can interact with a program. The back-end is
the part that performs the different functions necessary for the program and generally gets the job done, compared to the front-end it is lengthy
and would be as appealing to users as the front-end. The database is where all these functions and information are stored. An analogy for the three
would be viewing them as a "restaurant" setting, the front-end are the salespeople and the cashiers, the back-end are the staff working to cook 
and prepare the food, while the database is the location of the "restaurant" itself where all the personnel are contained.
